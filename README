NAME
    Test::Environment - Base module for loading Test::Environment::Plugin::*

SYNOPSIS
            use Test::Environment qw{
                    PostgreSQL
                    Dump
            };
        
            # now we have 'psql', 'dump_with_name', ... functions in current namespace.
            # imported from Test::Environment::Plugin::PostreSQL and Test::Environment::Plugin::Dump

            eq_or_diff(
                    [ psql(
                            'switches' => '--expanded',
                            'command'  => 'SELECT * FROM Table LEFT JOIN OtherTable USING (other_id) ORDER BY other_id;',
                    ) ],
                    [ dump_with_name('test_01.dump') ],
                    'check db loading',
            );

DESCRIPTION
    This is the base module to load Test::Environment::Plugin::* modules.

    Also sets:

            $ENV{'RUNNING_ENVIRONMENT'} = 'testing';

    The basic idea is to call all the plugins you will need in your testing
    script. The plugins will export their routines so you can use them in
    your tests easily. By the $ENV{'RUNNING_ENVIRONMENT'} you can announce
    that you are running in the testing mode to all the components of your
    tool. For example MyApp::Config module can decide uppon the %ENV from
    where to run the configuration file. (for testing look in t/conf/
    instead of conf/ for ordinary usage)

FUNCTIONS
  import()
    Will load choosen Test::Environment::Plugin::? plugins.
